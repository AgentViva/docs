# Changelog

Every change to the public AgentViva API, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## How we version

The API is `v1`. A breaking change gets a new path prefix, not a silent edit — `/v1` will keep behaving the way
this repository describes for as long as anyone is calling it. Additive changes (a new field, a new endpoint,
a new `reason` value) ship without notice, so parse defensively: ignore fields you do not know, and treat an
unrecognised `state` or `reason` as "something we have not seen yet" rather than an error.

Anything marked **v1** in [api.md](api.md) is planned, not built. Do not depend on it.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.
